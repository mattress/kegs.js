kegs.js
=========

A Kegerator Interface!
Use this to display the contents of your kegerator and also semi-track the keg volume by recording the amounts of your pours. Kinda ghetto sure, but you don't need a raspberry Pi and flow meters or scales or whatever.



Notes
------------------------
Written with angular and uses php to record the keg pulls to the json file.
